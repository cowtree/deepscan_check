# Model Card: Iris Flower Classifier

## Model Details

**Developed by:** [Your Organization/Team]  
**Model type:** Classification  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last updated:** 2025-07-17  
**License:** [e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, Proprietary]  
**Model Architecture:** Pipeline (StandardScaler â†’ RandomForestClassifier) with hyperparameter optimization (GridSearchCV)

## Features

### Input Features
- **sepal length (cm):** numeric feature representing the length of the sepal, standardized.  
- **sepal width (cm):** numeric feature representing the width of the sepal, standardized.  
- **petal length (cm):** numeric feature representing the length of the petal, standardized.  
- **petal width (cm):** numeric feature representing the width of the petal, standardized.

### Feature Engineering
- All input features are scaled using `StandardScaler` before model training.

### Feature Requirements
- All four features are required.  
- Input data must be numeric and in the same units (cm).  
- Missing values are not handled by the pipeline.

## Intended Use

### Primary Intended Uses
- Classification of Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

### Primary Intended Users
- Data scientists and researchers exploring classification pipelines.

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases
- Any application beyond Iris species classification.

## Factors

### Relevant Factors
- Feature measurement accuracy (e.g., measurement instrument precision).

### Evaluation Factors
- Stratified split by target class to ensure balanced evaluation.

## Metrics

### Model Performance Measures
- **Accuracy:** 0.9111  
- **Precision (weighted):** 0.9155  
- **Recall (weighted):** 0.9111  
- **F1 Score (weighted):** 0.9107 

## Evaluation Data

### Datasets
- **Training Data:** 105 examples  
- **Test Data:** 45 examples

### Motivation
- Standard Iris dataset split ensures representative class distribution.

### Preprocessing
- Standard scaling applied to all features.

## Training Data

### Training Data Overview
- **Size:** 105 examples  
- **Collection process:** Split from the built-in Iris dataset.  
- **Preprocessing:** Scaled using `StandardScaler`.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Data Privacy:** Iris dataset is public and contains no sensitive information.  
- **Potential Biases:** Limited to three species; may not generalize beyond dataset.  
- **Potential Risks:** Misclassification in edge cases.

## Caveats and Recommendations

- Ensure input features match units and order used during training.  
- Avoid using the model on non-Iris datasets.

## Quantitative Analyses

### Performance Breakdown
- See `classification_report` in the evaluation logs for per-class metrics.
